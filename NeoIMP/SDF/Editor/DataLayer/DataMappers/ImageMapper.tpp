    //  ?noredirect=1&lq=1
    // where he seems to have implicitly endorsed suggestion by the OP that to pass a factory or
    // otherwise have a data mapper create domain objects violates the single-responsibility
    // principle, but it seems hard to see a solution for how this can be avoided when the domain
    // object in question is a composite, as in the case of an image, thus requiring additional
    // domain objects (the components of the composition) to be created for which they cannot be
    // predicted in advance because they depend on the content of the file, so someone who has more
    // understanding of what's going on can/should weigh in on this and explain if there is a better
    // way to do this or whether it really is as problematic as the two there are implying it is.
    //
    // Hence right now we are creating domain objects directly - we could use a factory, but still
    // note what is said there. The persister creates domain objects (components of ImageT).
